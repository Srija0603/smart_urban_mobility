This project focuses on developing a Smart Urban Mobility system using IoT and AI to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and enhance transportation efficiency. It enables data-driven decision-making for sustainable urban transport and improved commuter experiences.
Smart Flow is an adaptable traffic management system that uses real-time data, IoT sensors, and machine learning to improve urban mobility. It optimizes traffic signal timings, predicts congestion hotspots, and promotes sustainable transport. Features include dynamic green light adjustment based on lane traffic, wrong-route alerts, and enhanced road safety. Graphical analysis and statistical validations demonstrate its effectiveness, making it valuable for city planners and policymakers aiming for efficient, eco-friendly, and responsive urban traffic management.
